# 📝 Flask Notes App Deployment using Ansible on AWS EC2

## 📘 Project Description

Additionally, the deployment includes:
- A **Systemd service** to run the Flask app persistently
- A **backup strategy** to copy the notes database hourly using a cron job

## 🛠️ Deployment Steps

### 1. Clone the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayahelhwary/ansible-notes-app.git
cd ansible-project
```

### 2. Update the Inventory File (`hosts`)
Add your EC2 instance public IP:

```ini
[web]
<your-ec2-ip> ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/your-key.pem
```

### 3. Run the Ansible Playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
```

### 4. Access the App in Your Browser
```
http://<your-ec2-ip>:5000
```

Or:
```
http://<your-ec2-ip>
```
if you configured the app to run on port 80.
